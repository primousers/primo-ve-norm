USE CASE: Remove author authority controls numbers
I have an OAI import that has contains author authority controls numbers. I need a rule to remove these brackets and numbers.

<dc:creator>Suphicha Muangsri (6926357)</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wendy McWilliam</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Tim Davies (13927464)</dc:creator>

USING THESE RULES (One rule for each author in your import file):

rule "Truncate author authority controls numbers"
when
exist "//[name()='dc:creator'][1]"
then
set TEMP"1" to xPath "//[name()='dc:creator'][1]"
remove substring using regex (TEMP"1","\\([0-9]*\\)")
set TEMP"1" in "dc"."creator"
end

rule "Truncate author authority controls numbers[2]"
when
exist "//[name()='dc:creator'][2]"
then
set TEMP"1" to xPath "//[name()='dc:creator'][2]"
remove substring using regex (TEMP"1","\\([0-9]*\\)")
set TEMP"1" in "dc"."creator"
end

rule "Truncate author authority controls numbers[3]"
when
exist "//[name()='dc:creator'][3]"
then
set TEMP"1" to xPath "//[name()='dc:creator'][3]"
remove substring using regex (TEMP"1","\\([0-9]*\\)")
set TEMP"1" in "dc"."creator"
end

WILL RETURN:

<dc:creator>Tim Davies</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Wendy McWilliam</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Suphicha Muangsri</dc:creator>

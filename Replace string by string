USE CASE: Replace string by string
This rule, stores the identifier value into TEMP 1 and then uses "replace string by string" to find a regex string pattern (^objects-) and do a find and replace on the string matching the regex. '^objects-' is replaced by "https://blockmuseum.emuseum.com/objects/"
For example, if the identifier is 'objects-12345', it will be replaced with "https://blockmuseum.emuseum.com/objects/12345"

EXAMPLE RECORD: A record contains the following dc:type elements.

<record>
    <header>
        <identifier>objects-12345</identifier>
        <datestamp>2021-07-15T11:52:45Z</datestamp>
        <setSpec>lr:EDT</setSpec>
    </header>
...
</record>

rule "source"​
when​
  true​
then​
  set TEMP"1" to xPath "//*[local-name()='record']/*[local-name()='header']/*[name()='identifier']" ​
  replace string by string (TEMP"1","^objects-","https://blockmuseum.emuseum.com/objects/")​
  set TEMP"1" in "dc"."source"​
end

WILL RETURN:

<dc:source>https://blockmuseum.emuseum.com/objects/12345</dc:source>
	
*This rule was contributed here, with approval, by Alice Tippit, based on her 2024 ELUNA presentation,presentation included a rule example for "replace string by string":
rule "source"​ through the following issue: PrimoBO: Replace string by string (https://github.com/primousers/primo-ve-norm/issues/14)
